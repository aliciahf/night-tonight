Make sure to work on a branch before merging to master to minimize bug conflicts and keep a healthy change log. Repo currently requires a PR (Pull Request) review before merging any branch-based code changes.

To submit a PR:
- Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab above
- Click on "New Pull Request"
- Set "compare" to your branch name. Base should be "master".
- Hit "Create Pull Request". In the PR description, outline the changes you made.


Any questions, let me know.
